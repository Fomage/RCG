# RCG
Random Character Generator, used to quickly setup Colisée games!

## Requirements
Python 3 or higher.

## Description
`CharacterBank.txt`: contains the characters, by origin universe.
`GameObject.py`: contains the engine code that randomly sample characters from a dictionary of characters.
`generate.py`: super-redundantly-name file that generate a `RCG.py` file when run.

## Usage
To generate a standalone usable script, run `python generate.py`.
To play, run `python RCG.py`, then enter the number of characters to sample.
When prompted for using different sources, enter 1 for yes and 0 for no.
You can then reroll a single character by entering its number, or reroll all the characters by entering -1.
